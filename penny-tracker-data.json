She peed inside before her afternoon walk, seemed to have a panic attack while going to poop, and was very anxious, taking the better part of an hour to calm down.

      "notes":"Today Penny was finally able to find relief from all her suffering. She's been so brave through all of this, and if she was in pain, she never showed it till toward the end. Even then, last night she slept all the way through for the first time in weeks, and this morning, despite not hardly being able to move she peed and pooped when being let out just like he had for years. She was the best dog. I'm so glad she was able to have a such a calm, relaxing transition to a well-deserved peace.",
